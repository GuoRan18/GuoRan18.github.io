Most bloggers have a simple introduction page, which is usually called “关于” in Chinese or “about” in English. To be honest, I don’t really like this word as it gives a dull impression. Moreover, since I started blogging, I haven’t really introduced myself, at most just mentioning my contact information. On social networks, most people only showcase their best side and even exaggerate their qualities. Many people are also reluctant to reveal too much about themselves online, and I belong to that category. Actually, the main reason is that I have never really summarized myself properly.

I used to love ranting on Weibo, WeChat, and I was also keen on Instagram (randomly taking photos with my phone). But a few days ago, I cleared out my Instagram and now I feel much lighter.

### Who am I?

INFP.

A mix of the 80s and 90s generation, a nearsighted person who doesn’t wear glasses. Graduated from HIT.

I have some characteristics of a programmer, but I don’t consider myself one, nor do I aspire to be one. My ideal profession is to be a university teacher.

Although I am from Northeast China, I lack the typical traits of a Northeasterner. I believe my biggest virtue is being sincere with others, even though I have been taken advantage of countless times. I always believe that there are more good people than bad people in this world. I may be naive, but not foolish. I won’t give anyone a second chance to deceive me.

I have very poor looks, but for a long time, I ignored this problem because other aspects of my life were too bright. It was not until I came across the “Zhihu’s Face Theory” that I realized it was a serious problem. Since then, I have started paying attention to my appearance and have accumulated a wealth of knowledge about fashion and cosmetics.

### My skills

In a resume, showing skills is to let employers know what you can do, but here, showing skills is more about showing off, because most of my skills are not really applicable in a job context.

I have some knowledge about perfumes and skincare products, but I know nothing about makeup.

I am adept in Western cuisine recipes, but I lack knowledge of etiquette. I am capable of cooking Chinese cuisine, but I don’t enjoy it.

I have certain front-end skills including, but not limited to, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I have certain back-end skills including, but not limited to, PHP and shell scripting.

I have self-studied law and psychology. While I am diligently preparing for the law exams, I have given up on psychology.

I am a theoretical expert in fitness.

I have some experience playing Texas Hold’em but due to financial reasons, I haven’t played much.

### What is this website about?

This website is my newly opened blog. I haven’t decided what to write yet, and I don’t even know if I will continue. However, one thing I can be certain of is that I will write about everything I am good at, such as food, skincare, online shopping, medicine, and so on. I’m just not sure where I will write them. If this blog can survive, these topics will definitely appear on this website. I am aware that it’s difficult to excel in such a wide range of fields, but as a personal blog, I don’t want to make it too ambitious. However, if this website becomes really amazing, I won’t refuse that either.

For a long time, this website will not have any link exchanges or advertisements. Suddenly, I thought that other people’s self-introductions are just one page, but I want to turn this website into my personal introduction.

So, this website is my introduction.
